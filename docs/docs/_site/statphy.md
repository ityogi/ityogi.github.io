== Course Description
A large number of local microscopic interactions can lead to many interesting macroscopic physical phenomena. 
These effects have been observed in physical systems, and statistical physics presents models that can describe such effects. 
In this course, we will learn the techniques from statistical physics to describe complex network behaviors. 

== Prerequisite
First graduate course in probability from any engineering or math department. 
Familiarity with information and coding theory is desired, though not necessary to attend the course.
