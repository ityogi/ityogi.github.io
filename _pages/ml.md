## Teams/GitHub Information 
### Teams 
We will use Microsoft Teams for all the course related communication.
*Please do not send any email regarding the course.* 
You can signup for the course team Foundations-Machine-Learning-2022 using the following code *q8qd4up*.
To be on the course team, you have to be formally registered for the course.
If you are registered for the course and not on the course team Foundations-Machine-Learning-2022, please send me a direct message on Teams.

#### GitHub
Students can signup for [GitHub](https://github.com/). 
All the students in the class have read access to GitHub public repository  [Machine-Learning](https://github.com/TeachingReps/Machine-Learning). 
For the write access to this GitHub repository, please send me your github userid on the course slack channel.
GitHub would be used for scribing lecture notes and submitting programming assignments.
Please follow the guidelines in the [sample lecture](https://github.com/TeachingReps/Machine-Learning/blob/master/sampleLecture.pdf).
The source file for the [sample lecture](https://github.com/TeachingReps/Machine-Learning/blob/master/sampleLecture.tex) is in the repository.
It is recommended you save it with another name in your local repository for creating a new lecture.
Here is [a good book for Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and [a simple tutorial](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1).
