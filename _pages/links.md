## For Graduate Students
As a graduate student and researcher, one needs to present one's work to the scientific community. This presentation can be in terms of an article, or an oral presentation. Please find below a number of links that advise on improving writing and presentation skills.

## Academic Writing
### LaTeX
For preparing professional quality papers/reports in science, [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is one of the most commonly used tool. There are a variety of editors that make writing in LaTeX easier. I personally use [TeXnicCenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeXnicCenter). 

### LyX
Various researchers recommend [LyX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LyX) because it flattens the LaTeX learning curve significantly. Please find below a list of web resources to help you get started.

- [LaTeX (Organization)](http://www.latex-project.org/)
- [BibTeX (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX)
- [LyX/LaTeX on Mac](http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/LyXOnMac?from=LyX.Mac)
- [LyX/LaTeX on Windows](http://wiki.lyx.org/Windows/Windows)
- [LyX (Organization)](http://www.lyx.org/)

### Beamer 
[Beamer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_%28LaTeX%29) is a tool to create presentations in LaTeX.

### PGF/TikZ
[PGF/TikZ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) is one of the powerful tools to create graphics in LaTeX. You need to write simple code to create graphics and it doesn't have a graphical interface. However, the code is highly re-usable.

### Git
[Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) is a distributed version control system.
